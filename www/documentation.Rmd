### Step 1: Prepare Data 

LogFSM can analyze log data from different sources. Different input formats are supported: 

- CSV file with one line for each event (PersonIdentifier, TimeStamp or RelativeTime, EventName, and Element are required, any key-value pair of event-specific data is possible)
- XML data generated with the Execution Environment of the CBA ItemBuilder
- CSV data exported from the PIAAC LogFileAnalyzer
- Other formats are under development

### Step 2: Define FSM

LogFSM requires to specify finite-state machine in a simple syntax. 
 
### Step 3: Reconstruct Sequence of States

Using the finite-state machine syntax defined in step 2, the log data are analyzed, and the sequence of states is reconstructed.

### Step 4: Read Output Tables

From the reconstructed sequence of states, LogFSM creates various output tables and graphs that can be used to extract indicators.
